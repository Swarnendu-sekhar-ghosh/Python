# Python

This is a repository consisting of all tutorial codes of "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to hero in Python " in Udemy by Jose Portilla. This course really helped me as a beginner to python programming. I have come back to this course over and over again to understand the basics as I donot come from a computer science background. I have even included the tests which I tried to solve while doing the course. 

Python is one of the demanding programming languages in recent times. And working in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence do require the knowledge about Python to deploy complex AI models in the field.

This course did give me an idepth idea about how to use python in area of interest.
