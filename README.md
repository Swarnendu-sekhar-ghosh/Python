# Python

Python is one of the most demanding programming languages in recent times. Working in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence requires knowledge of Python to deploy complex AI models in the field. This repository holds the practice sequences that I followed for understanding and learning coding in Python. 


The first book that has been considered for practising the hands-on exercises is the book " Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes". All the corresponding practice questions from this book are held within the folder BOOK1.
